About structure:
Would be a good idea to put all of the "include()" in the header.php?
And open there the session too - session_start()? isn't a problem to call the session_start() every time you use header.php?

About forms:
If it's better to only use a form in a page, how can you manage search engine, shopping list or feedback from users?
All in one form?
What can you do if you need to types of forms? Get for search engine and Post for login in the same page?
